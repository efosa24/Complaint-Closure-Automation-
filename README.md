# Complaint-Closure-Automation-
This project is an end-to-end Python automation pipeline designed to support global complaint management reporting across multiple regions
The script:

Calculates custom reporting periods using a 4-week (28-day) calendar with a −45-day offset

Extracts and cleans complaint data

Flags late vs. on-time complaints

Removes duplicates and excluded brands/categories

Generates region-specific pivot summaries

Exports multi-sheet Excel reports

Automatically emails the final reports

This solution is suitable for regulated environments (e.g., pharmaceutical, healthcare, consumer goods) where timeliness and traceability are critical.
